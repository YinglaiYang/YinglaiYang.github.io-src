Title: About
Status: published

This is my personal blog, where I share my experiences and insights from my career in the automotive industry.

I just love how this industry combines business and technology while having a strong connection to people. Every day there is something new to learn. Some of it makes it in a refined form onto this blog.

Hopefully, these will be of use for some or at the very least give you a laugh or two.

Enjoy!
