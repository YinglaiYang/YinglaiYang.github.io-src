Title: CAReer - An Assessment of a Rotational Program
Category: Leadership
Tags: work; career; leadership

Almost one and a half years ago I started my working career as a fresh graduate from university by joining the CAReer-program of Daimler.

With my background as an electrical and computer engineer, the automotive industry and Daimler in especially have become a very attractive place to be and work on trending topics like autonomous driving, connectivity and mobility services.

The final cherry on top of the cake was the combination with the rotational program since it became quite clear that I wanted to work in a more leading, coordinating and general role rather than on very specialized topics in my last two years before graduation.

Now, after I have almost finished the rotational program, it is time to share some experiences and also time for some reflections.
