Title: My Week in Retail
Category: Business
Tags: work; business; retail; customers; service


Recently, I had the chance to spend a week at the Mercedes-Benz dealership in Hamburg. During this time I got a look into how a dealership like this is being run and what the challenges are that they face, but also a feeling of the opportunities that are still possible in retail.

The dealership of Hamburg consists of six stores (also called "Centers") that are effectively held by the Daimler AG. The center in *Wandsbek* which is the headquarters of the dealership network "North" is where I spent the larger part of the week (Monday to Thursday), while on Friday I was in the *me Store Hamburg*, the prototype of a city store for Mercedes and lab for digital in-store retailing.

In the last few years the Daimler dealership landscape in Germany underwent significant changes. First, a large amount of dealerships has been sold off to other distributors. Second, the remaining dealerships have been reorganized into a GmbH that is being held by Daimler AG and wages .... Finally, the structure of the remaining dealerships has been tightened.
